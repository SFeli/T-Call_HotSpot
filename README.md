# T-Call HotSpot
Internetgateway / HotSpot with TTGO T-Call 
The Idea: Since all IoT need a connection and WAN or LORAWAN is not allways availabe TTGO offers a module T-CALL, with a SIM800L-Module.
With this programm you can build up a HotSpot (a own Access Point 192.168.1.4) witch forwards HTTP - Requests to the internet and responds with the Internet page. Thus the IoT have a moble access to the internet where WLAN or LORAWAN is not available.
